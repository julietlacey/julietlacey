          <p>Dear Ivan,</p>

          <p>I understand you’ve written in hopes of sewing up the final threads that remain frayed and untouched since our mother’s death. The will has never been my top concern, what with how I have felt the cruelty of divinity lately. I’ve found myself, more and more, waking up gasping as sweat pours down my skin. Beads, like thousands of ants crawling off my body. As if the ants cannot stand to touch me either! My god! This incessant pain—when Lord-when will we stop growing?</p>

          <p>Mother’s death has affected me as well. I do, sometimes, think of the way she touched my cheek before bed when we were just boys. Some days, in the morning as I drink a cup of coffee I must take a shaky breath when I realize she is gone. But what has cut me deeper is the wound that Miley has left.</p>

          <p>I found a blonde hair in my bed, a long one, the length from my elbow to my shoulder. I cried for thirty minutes, maybe more—the kind of cry when you can’t see what’s in front of you anymore. For months I thought she was cheating on me, but with this blonde hair, I suddenly knew. Do you know what it is like to have been lied to for almost half your life? You Ivan, you always said there was something off about my wife. You are an astute man. You always have been.</p>
          
          <p>Brother, I must give you, in writing, consent to do as you must with the will. I understand I am in no state to follow through with the wishes of our dear Frances. I read the legal documents she has left behind and I weep, for I will never know a love so gentle again. Miley has left me broken in a cold home, unable to see the daily activities I must get done. For each trivial object remains blurred by the tears in my eyes, from the time I wake up, to the time I let my body curl up into itself with the thought, ‘take me, mind, to a celestial place far from the truths I must endure when the sun is up.’ 
.</p>

          <p>I thought, after Miley and I had dissolved into each other the way we did, we could never truly hurt each other. I thought the love we felt for one another was greater than any obstacle! To be in love is to be so wildly foolish, my brother.</p>

          <p>Lately I have been thinking of the time when I proposed to her. Why would she have said yes? What dreadful woman would have said yes?</p>
            
          <blockquote class="blockquote">We were sitting in a Starbucks and the light came in just right. It made her favorite denim shirt look golden blue and I felt something tug inside of me—like I was sick but sort of in a way I liked. And I just asked. I asked her to share her life with me, to marry me.<blockquote class="blockquote">
            
          <p>What kills me, even now, is how happy she seemed when I asked her. I know micro expressions. I am very attentive. She did not hesitate, and I hold on to that image of pure delight as if I will die the moment I stop replaying it.</p>

          <p>But she hesitated after saying yes, and I caught that too.</p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">idk how to deal with images, it is beyond me.</span>

          <p>Do you get it, Ivan? She smiled and then she knew there was a problem. I chose to ignore this, the way we all do when we’re in love.</p>

          <p>I should have known that she was only showing me parts of her, but every part she showed me I sunk further into the dream of loving someone more than myself.</p>
            
          <p>People say to me I should move on now. She was horrible to me after all. Our whole relationship was nonexistent. But it’s so hard to believe the love between us could have been anything but some deep dying truth in this universe.</p>
           
          <p>In the twenty years we were married I would notice, here and there, that if a certain song were to come on in the casual stores we brought ourselves to it would affect her deeply. She would avoid eye contact, but I never asked because I thought if she wanted to share, she would. I am too respectful.</p>
            
          <p>I am sorry Ivan. I know Frances’ sudden death is more appealing to your sensory inputs for pain, but I fear Miley has taken over my mind entirely. And I realize I am perfectly able to call you on the phone and tell you these details but I fear my voice would break too easily and, anyway, I had to write this to you for the sake of the Clementine estate.</p>
            
          <p>It is yours. I do not care for a home as large as mother’s when I have no one to share it with. I will stay in my damp carpeted apartment just south of highway thirty-three.</p>
            
          <p>The paparazzi with find me wherever I go, so I may as well stay here. I’m sure you’ve seen it all in the news. The lies she told me, the lies her producers told her. What a twisted mess!</p>
            
          <p>I am sorry Ivan. I’m sure you’ve read the accounts on the New York Times and seen the Saturday Night Live sketch of Alec Baldwin playing me, finding Miley’s wig in her closet (I did not find it funny the way the millions of viewers did). What baffles me the most is how I have seen Hannah Montana on posters and not noticed the stark resemblance to my wife. Oh, how we lie to ourselves to stay in our comfortable bliss-filled lives! But how fake it all is!</p>
            
          <p>My brother, the estate is yours. Take it from me, as Miley has taken everything I have ever known. My heart rots in the stench of years of lies and the reasons to continue on seem further and further from my understanding. Please, take mother’s things and spread her ashes somewhere nice like that frozen yogurt place we always went to in Santa Monica. Or maybe somewhere with less frozen yogurt, I don’t know, that’s up to you, Ivan. But mother’s wishes are your responsibility now. I have far too much on my plate.</p> 
            
            <p>With Love,</p>
            <p>Keith</p>
            
            <p>*set in a universe in which the Hannah Montana franchise does not hinge on her double life, only her music. The music is three times better. Also, mustard does not exist in this universe for no reason other than I insist upon it.</p>
